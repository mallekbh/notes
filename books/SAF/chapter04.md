# Architecture Characteristics Defined
an architecture characteristic meets three criteria:<br>
- specifies a non domain design considiration<br>
- influences some structural aspect of the design<br>
- is critical or important to application success<br>

when designing an application, the requirements specify what the appliation should do, architecture characteristics specify operational and design criteria for success, concerning how to implement the requirements and why certain choices were made.<br>
the primary reason architects try to describe architecture characteristics on projects concerns design considerations: does this characteristic require a special design consideration to succeed?<br>
applications could support a huge number of architecture characteristics but shouldn't. support for each characteritic add complexity. thus the job of architects is to choose the fewest characteristics rather than the most possible.<br>
architecture characteristics are further subdivided into implicit and explicit characteristics. implicit ones rarely appear in requirements yet they are important for project success.<br>
- any list of architecture characteristics will necessarily be an incomplete list, any software may invent important architectural chracteristics based on unique factors.<br>
- many of the terms used are imprecise and ambiguous, sometimes because of subtle nuances or the lack of objective definitions.<br>
applications can only support a few of the architecture characteristics for a variety of reasons:<br>
- each of the supported characteristics requires design effort and perhaps structural support.<br>
- each architecture characteristic has an impact on others.<br>
- too many characteristics leads to generic solutions that are trying to solve every business problem.<br>
<br>
architects should strive to design architecture to be as iterative as possible.

**never shoot for the best architecture but rather for the least worst one.**
