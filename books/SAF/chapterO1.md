# Introduction

archtecture like much art, can only be understood in context. many of the decisions architects made were based on realities of the environement they found them selves in.<br>
a way of thinking about software architectures is that they consist of **the structure of the system (denoted as the heavy black lines supporting the architecture)**, combined with **architectural characteristics (-ilities)** the system must support, **archtecture decisions** and finally **design principales**.<br>
<br>
- the structure of the system refers to the type of architecture style (or styles) the system is implemented in.<br>
- archtectural charactristics define the success criteria of the system.<br>
- archtecture decisions define the rules for how the system should be constructed, and constraints that guide the development teams on what is what is not allowed.<br>
- design principales are guides rather then hard-and-fast rule.<br>

## Expectations of an Architect

there are eight core expectations placed on a software archtect, irrespective of any given role, title, or job description: <br>
- make architectural decisions<br>
- continually analyze the architecture<br>
- keep current with latest trends<br>
- ensure compliance with decisions<br>
- diverse exposure and experience<br>
- have business domain knowledge<br>
- possess interpersonal skills<br>
- understand and navigate politics<br>

**architectural decisions**<br>
an architect is expected to define the archtectural decisions and design principales used to guide technology decisions within the team, department, or accros the interprise.<br>
an architect should **guide** rather than **specify** technology choices.<br>
<br>
**continually analyze the architecture**<br>
an architect shouls contnually analyze the architecture and current technology environment and then recommend solutions for improvement. refers to software architecture vitality, which assess how viable a software architecture the was defined three or more years ago is today given changes in both business and technology.<br>
<br>
**keep current with latest trends**<br>
the decisions an architect makes tend to be long-lasting and difficult to change. understanding and following key trends helps the architect perpare for the future and make the correct decisions.<br>
<br>
**ensure compliance with decisions**<br>
continually verifying that development teams are continually following architectural decisions and design principales defined, documented and communicated by the architect.<br>
<br>
**diverse exposure and experience**<br>
an architect is expected to have exposure to multiple and diverse technologies, frameworks, plateforms and environments. an effective software architect should be aggressive in seeking out opportunities to gain experience in pultiple languages, plateforms and technologies. a good way of mastering is this is to focus on technical breadth rather than width. technical breadth includes stuffs you know about but not at a technical level combined with the stuffs you know a lot about.<br
<br>
**have business domain knowledge**<br>
effective architects understand not only technology but also the business domain of a problem space. without this knowledge an architect cannot communicate with stakeholders and business users and will quickly lose credibility.<br>
<br>
**possess interpersonal skills**<br>
an architect is expected to possess exceptional interpersonal skils, including teamwork, facilitation, and leadership. having exceptional leadership and interpersonal skills is a difficult expectation for most developers and architects. an architect is not only expected to provide technical guidance but also to lead the development teams in the implementations of the architecture. leadership skills are atleast half of what it takes to become an effective software architect. regardless of the role or title the architect has.<br>
<br>
**understand the negative politics**<br>
an architect is expected to understand to political climate of the enterprise and be able to navigate it.<br>
<br><br>
building evolutionary architectures co-opts the fitness function used by gentic algorithms to create architectural fitness function: an objective integrity assessment of some archtectural characteristics. this may include a variaty of mechanisms such as metrics, unit tests, monitors and chaos engineering. architects always know the status of critical part of the architecture because they have verficiation fitness mechanism in the form of fitness functions as part of the continuous integration process of the project.<br>

## Laws of Software Architecture
while the scope of software architecture is very broad, unifying elements do exist. the authors learned **the first law of software architecture** by constantly stumbling on it:<br>
**Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.**<br>
nothing exist on a nice, clean spectrum for software architects. every decision must take into account many opposite factors.<br>
<br>
we define software architecture in terms beyond structural scaffolding, incorporating principales, characteristics and so on:<br>
**why is more important than the how.**<br>
